title: Living in the Present

I wish I could start this off by saying "Many people have asked me this question...", but the sad reality is that I can't.

Far too many people today follow the principle of "Work now, relax later". So many motivational quotes and speeches have this idea embedded in them that it has become one of the core pillars of society. People live and work because of this motto, but forget a critical part of life, the beautiful present around them that they will never get to experience again. 

I'd like to preface this by saying that I do not disagree with this ideology. Thinking ahead into the future is a valuable skill that has helped people since the dawn of time. I do however believe that people take it far too seriously, and end up working themselves too hard. They end up neglecting the life around them because they only see the end goal, and are unable to enjoy their surroundings while they attempt to reach that endpoint.
 
In this short post I'd like to voice my thoughts on living life to its fullest from a perspective of a person who has zealously followed the beliefs of working now to be happy later for the majority of my life.

**The Argument**

The real reason the concept of prioritizing work to leisure is not foreign to human behavior. Everyone at some point in their life has experienced the joy that finished work brings. This amazing feeling of freedom and satisfaction that a completed task provides is the main cause of the widespread belief, and they are not wrong. The general concept of prioritizing the more important tasks is a safe and reliable option. It allows people to avoid situations where things go wrong last minute by starting in advance, or just allows them to live more relaxed, free of the burden of work. 

**The Issue**

The issues start when people take this advice far too seriously. This issue is the reason we have the word "workaholic", or a person that can only think about their work and nothing else. While that definition sounds a bit extreme, the reality is that the majority of people today are actually workaholics. They are simply unable to stop working. As soon as they finish one project, they start on another. They are the kinds of people that never miss a class or a day at work even if they are exhausted, because they are being fueled by the belief that this work will pay off one day and they will finally be able to relax.

A reason people often believe in this idea is school. It constantly pressures students to perform and compete to get into a college. Colleges continue this trend to encourage people to continue working to get a job, with the indirect threats of not being able to live a fulfilling life without it. Everything in our lives focuses us on the future, to the extent where the end goal becomes more important than enjoying the journey.

I was a victim of this belief. I would see people in less advanced classes that would consistently come to class late and forget to do their homework. I would look at them with slight disgust and contempt, reassuring myself that in 10 or 20 years, these people will be suffering in the real world, but I will be ready for it because of the time and effort I put in now, in school. 

**The Realization**

But they had something I didn't, and that was happiness. They did not care if they were late to class or if they are not as academically advanced as some of their peers. They were able to live in the present and enjoy their surroundings, enjoy the things they already had instead of dreaming about the things they would get. 

At some point I realized that they were right, and I was wrong. Every single day is unique, but I was not able to see that because my gaze was so far into the future, I refused to acknowledge the present. I studied while others were playing, and worked when others decided to rest. Most of the inspirational quotes you can easily find online would say that what I was doing is right, but it wasn't. As others grew happier, I was only getting deeper and deeper into work, and yet I was not pleased with my life. 

Which made me come to a sudden realization. What is the point of life if you do not enjoy it? Why seek happiness in the far future when it is all around you, all you need to do is pay attention? Is it really worth it to sacrifice childhood for the possibility of satisfaction in the future? When does that satisfaction come? 20 years? 30? The truth is that it will never come. People who continue working and living in the future will never reach the point they are promised if all they care about is the future. There is a reason why nobody is able to always accurately predict what will happen in the future, but you always know what is happening in the present. So why not enjoy the things happening now? The friends that you may not see in a couple years, the dumb, irrational decisions that you still have the excuse of making while you are young. These opportunities come once in a lifetime, and you will miss them if you are only looking forward. 

**The Race**

The journey of life is not a race track with a definitive end, where you must always look forward to secure victory. It is more of a long path in the park. You cannot see the end of it, but if you stop and look around you, you will see beautiful trees and hear birds chirping. The people that treat life like a race track will continue racing until they see the final stretch, without realizing that that there is no finish. Yet when you are walking in the park, you do not care about your final destination, but you are able to enjoy the journey you are taking.

Of course, work still has to be done. Work is what drives society forward. Work is the tool that allows people to expand themselves and learn more. But it is still a tool. You must control the tool, not vice versa. Do not give up the present for something that may not even happen in the future. Enjoy the things you have, rather than the things you might get. Remember that time is fragile, and can go by quick, so make sure to appreciate and love the present. Do not let the future swallow you whole, because while the future can still be bright, you will never be complete if you miss out on the things you can do today.
